Clipper Libraries for Crystallographic Computing
================================================

The aim of the clipper project is to produce a set of object-oriented
libraries for the organisation of crystallographic data and the performance
of crystallographic computation. The clipper libraries are written by Kevin
Cowtan, University of York, UK.

This is the top index, with links to the core clipper interface, plus
links to the various optional interfaces.
